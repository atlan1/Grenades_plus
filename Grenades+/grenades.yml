# Here you can configure your own grenades!
# Look at the examples to see how it works.

# There are two supercategories: Throwable (for throwable Grenades) and Placeable (for mines etc.)
Throwable:

        speed-multiply: 1.2
        # the effects radius, means the sphere radius which will be searched for entitys and blocks to perform effects at
