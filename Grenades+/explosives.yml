# In this section you define explosives that can be thrown by pressing the throw key defined in general.yml
Throwable:
    # The first thing to do is to give your explosive a name
    Grenade:
        # You also need to give it a texture like that:
        texture: 'http://dl.dropbox.com/u/44243469/GrenadesPack/Textures/itemGrenade.png'
        # And of course some nice sound; you can also change the volume
